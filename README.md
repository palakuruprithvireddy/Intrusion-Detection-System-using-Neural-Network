The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) represents a paradigm shift in transportation, enabling vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication for improved traffic efficiency and 
safety. However, this connectivity introduces significant security vulnerabilities, necessitating advanced Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This project presents an intelligent IDS leveraging 
neural networks to detect and mitigate cyber threats in IoV environments. Using the IDS 2017 dataset, we demonstrate high detection accuracy, low false alarms, and real-time threat identification 
capabilities. The results emphasize the potential of machine learning-based IDS for enhancing IoV security. The model used in this project is an artificial neural network, a type of machine learning 
model that is particularly effective in recognizing patterns in complex data. The system was trained and tested on the processed data, and its performance was evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy and precision. 
The results demonstrate that the system is effective at detecting various types of security threats, offering a promising approach for improving the safety of connected vehicle networks.
